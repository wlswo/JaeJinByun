  <samp> I am a backend developer who is interested in web and server development. In a Linux environment, I mainly focus on developing backend servers based on java and spring boot and building on-premise infrastructure. We pursue a development culture of cloud infrastructure, in-house technology sharing, mutual feedback, code review, etc., and pursue an active attitude in communication to solve problems.
